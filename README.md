A basic four-function calculator.

This calculator can compute the four basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
It also has functions to add decimal points, convert to percent, change input to negative/positive.

This was mainly done using JavaFX.
Created a model calculator java class that did all the main calculations, and other functions.
Created a view that displayed the GUI for the calculator.
Used a BorderPane as the scene, which included: a GridPane of buttons in the center, and a label signifying the display of calculator at the top.

This design was inspired by the IOS Mac Calculator.
